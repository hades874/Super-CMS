## Style Guidelines

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A085CF) for a sophisticated educational feel.
- Background color: Light lavender (#F2F0FA), desaturated for ease of viewing.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#73A7AD) for interactive elements and highlights, for calm contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, is recommended for its modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, consistent icons to represent different question types, subjects, and actions (e.g., edit, delete, add). Favor outline icons for a modern, lightweight feel.
- A clean, intuitive layout that emphasizes drag-and-drop functionality, filtering and metadata clearly on the side.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user interactions, such as highlighting questions when dragging and dropping, and providing feedback on actions (e.g., saving, deleting).
